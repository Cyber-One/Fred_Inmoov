Notes for when running on the Raspberry Pi.

When using Java 11 OpenJDK, you may find the audio from the Text To Speech coming out the HDMI port instead of the selected 3.5mm Audio socket on the side of the Raspberry Pi.
This is caused by Pulse Audio not following the requested settings and routing the audio from the Java apps to a different output, the HDMI like it or not.
The solution is to edit the Java sound.properties file.

sudo nano /etc/java-11-openjdk/sound.properties

You will need to add in the following lines into the config:

javax.sound.sampled.Clip=com.sun.media.sound.DirectAudioDeviceProvider
javax.sound.sampled.Port=com.sun.media.sound.PortMixerProvider
javax.sound.sampled.SourceDataLine=com.sun.media.sound.DirectAudioDeviceProvider
javax.sound.sampled.TargetDataLine=com.sun.media.sound.DirectAudioDeviceProvider

Make sure you don't have the # in front of the lines.
Reboot the Raspberry Pi.

sudo reboot

Make sure you selected the 3.5mm Audio jack as your output device:

alsamixer

press F6 to select the sound card you want as the output.
Select 1 Headphones.
now change into your MRL directory and start MRL the way you normally would.
