Accessing the Xbox 360 Kinect using the Raspberry Pi

Once you have the unit connected and up and working, you can access the images. 
First, you'll need to install a library called freenect, which will make it very easy to access both the regular and depth images from the Kinect 360. 

To do this, type 
sudo apt-get install freenect
You'll also need a library to allow you to access freenect from Python; to get this, type 
sudo apt-get install python-freenect
Once you have the libraries installed, you'll also need to install a library that will allow you to access the images on the Raspberry Pi graphics system. 
To do this, type 
sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-swx11

You can check to see if everything is working by opening a vncserver window and typing 
freenect-glview
You should see something like this:

Using this in MyRobotLab (MRL) is also not that hard.
After starting MRL, launch the OpenCV service then select the Kinect as the camera source and click on Capture.
