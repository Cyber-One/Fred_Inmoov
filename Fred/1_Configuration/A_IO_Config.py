# Passive Infra Red (PIR) works on the principle that a 
# warm body emits Infra Red (IR) light. The level of this 
# light can indicate the current temperature.
# PIR sensors, use a single sensing element to measure the 
# ambient IR level.
# By using a segmented lens in front of the sensor, there 
# will be areas where the sensor can not see the IR 
# levels, and areas where it is amplified.  
# As a warm body such as a person moves from one area to 
# another, there is a large change in the IR levels 
# detected, when this change occurs the output of the PIR 
# sensor is turned on.

# Ultrasonic sensors emit a pulse of high frequency sound normally
# 8 cycles at a frequency the we can not hear.
# They then wait for the reflected sound to be detected.
# The time taken for the sound pulse to travel to an object and be
# reflected back can be timed and give a reasonable indication of
# the distance the object is away from the sensor.
# The speed of sound in air is about 343 metres per second 
# or 1,235 km/h; 1,125 ft/s; 767 mph.
# The speed of sound however will vary with temperature.
# Speed = 331.3 + (0.606 * airTemp) m/s
# Our robot use a Ultrasonic module to do the above, but we
# need to handle the time measurement.
# MRL offloads this to the Arduino, It starts the pulse
# transmission using the transmit pin, the times how long it
# takes for the receive pin to be pulsed high.
# From there it can do the math to get a distance.
# Pin 1 is used for the Transmit of the pulse.
# Pin 2 is used for the receive of the return pulse.

# Battery Voltage can be a very important thing to monitor
# when your robot is running on batteries.  For the most part
# this is done with a simple resistor divider network.
# For this to work, an analog pin needs to be allocated from
# one of the installed Arduino's.  A resistor divider network,
# two resistors connected in series is connected between the
# ground and the battery power.  The junction of the two
# resistors is then connected to teh Arduino's analoginput.
# The resistors are selected so that at no time would the
# voltage at the Arduino exceed 5 volts.
# For Freds build, he's using 20Vdc batteries, so if we use a
# 10K resistor between gnd and the input and a 56K resistor
# between the input and the battery, we should be safe up to
