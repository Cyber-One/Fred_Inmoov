# Each servo has a number of parameters that need to be setup 
# before it can be used, these include where it's attached 
# and how far it can be moved.
# In the InMoov scripts and services, it assumes that your 
# servos are connected to one of the Arduino Mega 2560's.
# In the case of Fred using the PCA9685, this is not the case.
# In this config, the only assumption I will make is that the
# Servo will be attaches somewhere :-)
# The default values will be one of our controllers.
# "arduinoLeft", "arduinoRight", "arduinoNano", "Head", 
# "Back", "RightArm", "LeftArm".
# If a new controller is released or more servos are added, 
# then add it to this list and to each of the servos in the 
# related Servo.py file.  In this case 1_Servos_Head.py
# Comments after the setting are for a Nervo Boards based 
# InMoov configuration as listed on the InMoov web site.
# In some cases, the direction of travel is sometime in the
# oposite direction to what we need.  In this case, swap the
# Min and Max pos, this will swap the direction to what we need.
