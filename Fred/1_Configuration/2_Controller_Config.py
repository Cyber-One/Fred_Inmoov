# The Raspberry Pi 4 is a small Single Board Computer (SBC)
# with enough power to experiment and run a lot of MRL 
# services, just not all at once. :-)
# Built on to the Raspberry Pi are the 
# General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) pins.  Amonst these are
# and I2C bus, a TTL Serial, I2S Audio bus and other general 
# purpose configurable Inputs and Outputs. 
# Note: The I2C bus is on Port 1. Pins 2 (SDA) and Pin 3 (SCL)
#       I2C Port 0 is used for the uSD card.
##############################################################
## NOTE: the GPIO are 3.3V only, applying 5V to these pins  ##
## will destroy your Raspberry Pi SBC, You have been warned ##

# Each of the Arduinos connect via USB, in the Rasberry Pi or

# Our servo controllers in Fred are the Adafruit 16 channel 
# PWM Servo drivers.  With four of these installed we will 
# need to create four separate service, one for each.
# Next we need to attach the servo drivers to the Raspi4 or 
# the Arduino
# There are three parameters we need to set,
#
# The first parameter is the service we want to attach it to, 
# normally either the RasPi or one of the Arduinos,
# "arduinoLeft", "arduinoRight" or "arduinoNano"
# in our case it will be the Raspi4. "raspi"
#
# The second parameter is the bus, This is normally 1 for the
# RasPi or 0 for an Arduino.
#
# Each servo driver has a unique address that is hard coded
# by means of a set of jumpers on the controller boards, This
# is our Third parameter, There are seven jumpers that form
# a binary number that is added to 0x40. Note the 0x 
# indicates the number is in hexadecimal format that is base
# 16 and has values in the range:
# 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F
# 0x40 is equal to 64 in decimal, the seven jumpers will give
# up to 128 possible address.
# Just be aware of any other I2C devices you have on the bus
# and what their address are, some device can not be changed
# or have a very limited number of selectable addresses.
