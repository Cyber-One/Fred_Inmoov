# in Fred's modified version its a JX PDI6221MG.

# located in the center of the torso between the front and

# Adapter and fitted a JX PDI6221MG servo.

# in turn allowing the head to maintain it's orientation when
# the head turns left or right while looking slightly up or down
# The roll Neck was first introduced by Bob Huston in his 
# build and embraced by many builders, later Gael redigned
# this to eliminate its major weaknes and has included it in
# the Official parts list. This is still an optional update.
