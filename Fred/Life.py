# Fred in a modified Inmmov robot, you can find all the

# Life.py
# This file is to Simulate movements associated with a

# To make is a bit easier to control, we define functions to move the two eyes togeter.
# if you have only the one servo for each of these axis, then comment out the RightEyeLR and the RightEyeUD lines.

# Pan and Tilt are the common methods of controlling a camera.
# normally, you would have a rotating base and the place a tilt mechinism on the pan base.
# we have a Pitch and Roll with the Yaw on top of that.
# When we look up at 20째 and then turn the head 90째 to the left,
# the head will end up with a tilt of 0째 but the head will roll 20째
# to overcome this we need a Pan and Tilt translation.
# This function assumes that 0, 0, 0 is facing straight ahead with tilt and roll level.

# Routines to create the blinking motion
# we use the Clock service to provide a regular event that calls the blink procedure.
# one of the things we do within the blink routine is to change the blink interval to a random number between 5 and 10 seconds.
# future enhancements may include shifting the random range based on the current light levels and the average light levels,
# blink more often when the light levels increase until an average value has been reached.
